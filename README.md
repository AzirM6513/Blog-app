# Blog App
This repo is the frontend for my Blog App that is hosted on heroku at https://blog-app-demo-heroku.herokuapp.com

## Local Build
If youd like to contribute or just muck around in the files. There is two branches on this repo, the main branch and development, the development branch will likely be ahead of the main branch in most cases.

### Clone Repo
1. git clone https://github.com/AzirM6513/Blog-app.git
2. (optional step for dev version of site) git checkout development
3. npm install

after the install you should be able to locally edit files.
